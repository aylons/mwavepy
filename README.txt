	mwavepy is a compilation of functions and class's for microwave/RF
engineering written in python. It is useful for things such as
touchstone file manipulation, calibration, data analysis, data acquisition,
 and plotting. The main interface is command line, using the python
 interpreter. mwavepy is also very useful for scripting tasks.

	Being that it has been built around my specific needs as a graduate
student, it is far from complete, but is more of a framework for future
development. I've tried to make mwavepy as simple yet flexible as possible.

Install instructions are given in INSTALL.txt

see docs/ and examples/ for more help .
