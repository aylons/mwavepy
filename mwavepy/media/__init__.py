.. module:: mwavepy.media
========================================
media (:mod:`mwavepy.media`)
========================================

Provides :class:`~media.Media` base-class and specific instances of
:class:`~media.Media` objects representing various transmission-line 
mediums.

The :class:`~media.Media` object provides generic methods to produce  
:class:`~mwavepy.network.Network`'s for any transmision line medium, such 
as :func:`~media.Media.line` and :func:`~media.Media.delay_short`. These
methods are inherited by the specific tranmission line classes, 
which interally define relevant quantities such as propagation constant,
and characteristic impedance. This allows the specific transmission line
mediums to produce networks without re-implementing methods for 
each specific media instance.

Network components specific to an given transmission line medium 
such as :func:`~media.cpw.CPW.cpw_short` and 
:func:`~media.microstrip.Microstrip.microstrip_bend`, are implemented 
in those object
