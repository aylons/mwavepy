frequency (:mod:`mwavepy.frequency`)

Provides a frequency object and related functions.

Most of the functionality is provided as methods and properties of the

class Frequency(object):
	'''
	A frequency band. 
	
	The frequency object provides a convenient way to work with and 
	access a frequency band. It contains  a fruequency vector as well as
	a frequency unit. This allows a frequency vector in a given unit
	to be available (:attr:`f_scaled`), as well as an absolute frquency
	axis in 'Hz'  (:attr:`f`).

	def __init__(self,start, stop, npoints, unit='hz', sweep_type='lin'):
		'''
		Frequency initializer.
		
		Creates a Frequency object from start/stop/npoints and a unit. 
		Alternatively, the class method :func:`from_f` can be used to 
		create a Frequency object from a frequency vector instead.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		start : number
			start frequency in  units of `unit`
		stop : number
			stop frequency in  units of `unit`
		npoints : int
			number of points in the band. 
		unit : ['hz','khz','mhz','ghz']
			frequency unit of the band. This is used to create the 
			attribute :attr:`f_scaled`. It is also used by the 
			:class:`~mwavepy.network.Network` class for plots vs. 
			frequency.
		
		Notes
		--------
		The attribute unit sets the property freqMultiplier, which is used 
		to scale the frequency when f_scaled is referenced.
		
		See Also
		---------
			from_f : constructs a Frequency object from a frequency 
				vector instead of start/stop/npoints. 
			
		Examples
		---------
		
		>>> wr1p5band = Frequency(500,750,401, 'ghz')
